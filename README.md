Talking about our Uber data analysis project, data storytelling is an important
component of Machine Learning through which companies are able to understand
the background of various operations. With the help of visualization, companies can
avail the benefit of understanding the complex data and gain insights that would help
them to craft decisions.
SCOPE
“Uber lives or dies by data. Their overall mission and their sustainability is
completely dependent on how good their data is. The more data they can
collect, the more information they can derive from patterns and behaviours.
Their ability to increase profits is all dependent on that.”- said Spencer, a
former Uber driver.
There is no need to look for a local taxi or to tip a bellman for the ride, you are
just a click away from a high-quality customer experience with Uber’s
revolutionizing data driven business model. Data is the biggest asset for Uber
and its complete business model is based on the big data principle of
crowdsourcing. Anybody with a car willing to help someone get to a desired
location can offer help in getting them there.
